# Stanford Cars - Image Classification using Deep Learning

I am currently working on this project and best so far I got 84.2% accuracy
using ResNet50 with PyTorch & FastAI library. This project helped me to understand
following things while experimenting around them-

 `(1) 'fit_one_cycle' (based on Leslie Smith's 1-cycle policy) helps in getting 
 better results than 'fit' method.`
 `(2) 'Differential Learning Rates' (i.e. lower for initial layers and relatively 
 higher for final layers ) give better results than 'Constant Learning Rate'.`

## Target :
To improve accuracy of ResNet50 CNN to 90%[+].

## Exposure :
Python, FastAI,PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, CNNs ResNet34 & ResNet50 architectures.
