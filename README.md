# Stanford Cars - Image Classification using Deep Learning

I am currently working on this project and best so far I got ~~84.2%~~ 89% accuracy using ResNet50 with PyTorch & FastAI library. This project helped me to understand following things while experimenting around them-

 `(1) 'fit_one_cycle' (based on Leslie Smith's 1-cycle policy) helps in getting better results than 'fit' method.`
 
 `(2) 'Differential Learning Rates' (i.e. lower for initial layers and relatively higher for final layers ) give better results than 'Constant Learning Rate'.`

Update :  By just training my model on realtively higher reslution images cross-validation accuracy improved by ~5% i.e. 89%;

## Exposure :
`• Explore Cyclical Learning Rates, Differential Learning Rates and Transfer Learning concepts.`

`• Tech Stack : FastAI [deep learning library built on top of Pytorch]`
